# RealTerm MATLAB Communication

The RealTermHandleClass allows to create a [RealTerm](https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/) server to perform asynchronous comunication via serial with an external device and MATLAB, this allows a faster performance when working with big data loads and is ideal when working in real-time applications. This repository includes:

* RealTermHandleClass: Class that allows the creation of an object than handle serial comunication with an external device using RealTerm.
* matlab_example: Example using the RealTermHandleClass to plot data comming from the external device.
* arduino_serial: Example of arduino code to send data via serial.
